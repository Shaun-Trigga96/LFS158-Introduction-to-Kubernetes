# Accessing Minikube

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will learn about different methods of accessing a Kubernetes cluster.

We can use a variety of external clients or custom scripts to access our cluster for administration purposes. We will explore kubectl as a CLI tool to access the Minikube Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes Dashboard as a web-based user interface to interact with the cluster, and the curl command with proper credentials to access the cluster via APIs.
